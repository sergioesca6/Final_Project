On the putting green, it's the ability to make putts in clutch situations, and do it on a regular basis. It's about owning a stroke that works, not necessarily one that looks pretty or is fundamentally perfect (although many great putters are both smooth and sound). It's about wielding that blunt instrument as a weapon, not as something you use to mop up any mess you've made with your woods and irons. That's why the most prestigious golf tournament in history is only won by the greatest putters in the world. But how important is putting in the game?</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>Consider par: the evaluation of how many strokes a highly-skilled player would take to get the ball in the hole to have an excellent score. It's based on the length of the hole plus two putts -- always two putts. If there are 18 holes on a golf course and each green is worth two putts that means that par for putting is 36. The majority of 18-hole golf courses are par 72. That means that half of par is putting. That's an interesting way to look at it. So the importance of putting cannot be overemphasized. Acknowledging that touring professionals play, practice and work on their games pretty much day in and day out, and realizing the complexity of the full swing and the general lack of control over the outcome of longer shots, do you think that your best chance of lowering your score, given the amount of time you have to practice, is with the long game or with the short game? Since the best players in the world can only manage a two-thirds success rate at hitting the greens the answer is fairly clear. Your best chance of lowering your score lies with the short game, beginning with putting in particular.</p>
